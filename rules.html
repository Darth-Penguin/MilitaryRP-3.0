        <p>This gamemode is <strong>NOT</strong> pure Team Deathmatch. The purpose of this game mode is to emulate realistic military situations and conflicts.</p>
	<p>Players are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed under the map under any circumstances. If found under the map you will be banned for one week, if you are found with printers it will be a month. If you happen to fall through just type "kill" in console.</p>

                <font face=arial size=2>
            <ol>
                <li> Do not build on or around other bases.</li>

                <li> Factions must base at their own base.<br>
                    - Factions can only print at their base.</li>

                <li> War reasons must have a valid point. "Oil" is not a reason.</li>

                <li> If you are at your faction's base and you die during an enemy raid, do not go back to kill the raiders for 5 minutes.</li>

                <li> Do not spawn trap/kill people in their bases/spawns.</li>

                <li> There are now "war crimes". If a faction does one of the following things, the United Nations may take action.</li>
		              <ul>
                          <li> Illegally killing people from another faction.</li>
                          <li> Calling war on all for world domination.</li>
                          <li> Teaming with anarchists.</li>
                </ul>
                <li> Abductors may only abduct someone every 5 minutes.</li>
                <li> Raids may only last 10 minutes after you advert raid.</li>
                <li> Do not randomly handcuff or grapple people.</li>
                <li> Scavengers (and other equivalents) may counter raid a base that is being raided. You must do "/advert Counter Raid!"</li>
                <li> When abducting/kidnaping someone, you must do "/advert Abduction!".</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The max amount of money you can demand for a hostage is $50,000.</li>
                    <li>You may only abduct one person at a time.</li>
                    <li>Abductions may only last for 15 minutes after you advert. After that, you have to either kill them or let them go.</li>
                    <li>If you are abducted, you may not rejoin the server to avoid rp.</li>
                </ul>

    <div style="background-color: #041f45;">
        <center><font face=arial size=6 color="#FFFFFF"><b>General Rules</b></font></center>
            </div>
                <font face=arial size=2>
	<ol>
		<li>Shooting/killing in safezone is not permitted for any reason. If you shoot someone when you are outside of the safe zone, you are not permitted to reenter the safe zone for 30 seconds.</li>
		<li>No Racist / Sexist / Homophobic comments or names.</li>
		<li>Do not random death match (RDM). You must declare war to kill a member of another faction.</li>
		<li>Do not break new life rule (NLR). NLR applies to everyone. If you were raiding, do not return to the area you were killed at for atleast 5 minutes.</li>
		<li> Do not abuse your props. For example: 
			<ul>
				<li>prop blocking</li>
				<li>prop climbing</li> 
				<li>prop spamming</li>
				<li>prop surfing</li>
				<li>prop killing</li>
			</ul>
			Cars are considered props.
		</li>
		<li>Stealing is not permitted in SZ for any reasons, with the exception of printers.</li>
		<li>Running someone over in a car is classified as Car Deathmatch, a kind of RDM. This must be avoided at all costs. It is the responsibility of the driver to avoid players and the responsibility of players to avoid cars. There is no gray area; however, involuntary CDM, meaning CDM that occurred out of the control of either party, is automatically the responsibility of the driver.</li>
		<li>There must be at least one way into your base (with keypad, minimum time of 5 seconds).</li>
		<li>Keypads cannot be used to raid, you must use keypad crackers. If a friend types in the code or someone remembers it from being with that team, it is NLR and FailRP.</li>
		<li>You may not make a double fading door (2 fading doors on top of each other which traps the person trying to unlock the second door inside it, or in any other way unable to break into the base).</li>
		<li>Do not argue with staff, their word is final. If there is a dispute (no consensus), report it on the forums so that we may more quickly resolve the issue.</li>
		<li>Do not impersonate staff, this will get you a lengthy ban.</li>
		<li>Do not leave the server or area the admin brings you, to avoid your punishment. This can double your punishment. An admin situation is any where an administrator is present and communicating with any or all of the players in the area.</li>
		<li>Use common sense - if something isnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t explicitly stated in the rules, donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t use it as an excuse to exploit players or the server.</li>
		<li>Be respectful to all players and administrators.</li>
		<li>No hacking, glitching, or exploiting.</li>
		<li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> threaten other players or the server. (example: Denial of Service Attack).</li>
		<li>Do not block off any section of the map unless you own it. (buy all doors in area)</li>
		<li>Keep everything PG-13</li>
		<li>Do not link something that isn't PG-13 or can cause damage.</li>
		<li>Do not randomly demote players (you <strong>MUST</strong> have a reason).</li>
		<li>You cannot metagame to gain an advantage during a raid. If a friend types in the code or someone remembers it from being with the team being raided, it is NLR (switching teams/defecting for the purpose of coming back to raid) and FailRP</li>
		<li>Using /advert is like the newspaper, use it for spreading the word about something. Do <strong>NOT</strong> use it as an alternative for OOC.
			<ul>
				<li>Bad: "/advert Selling steam gift cards!"</li>
				<li>Good: "/advert USMC has declare war on Germany".</li>
			</ul>
			The only valid uses of advert include declarations of war, peace treaty offers, announcing a surrender, raid, raid assist, counter-raid, carjack, or mugging.
		</li>
		<li>No making an area that only you can see and shoot through.</li>
		<li>Do not spam the chat or your microphone.
			<ul>
				<li>Chat spam example: <p>Random Player (OOC):ADMIN</p>
				<p>Random Player (OOC):ADMIN</p>
				<p>Random Player (OOC):ADMIN</p>
				<p>Random Player (OOC):ADMIN</p>
				<p>Random Player (OOC):ADMIN</p></li>
				<li>Microphone spam example: Playing music through your microphone</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Admins will not respond to you if you use /ooc to report. Type @ then your message to report something to an admin. All other requests will be ignored.</li>
		<li>When requesting an administrator do not use all caps, and do not post multiple requests within 5 minutes.</li>
		<li>If you shoot someone outside of the safe zone, you are not permitted to reenter the safe zone for 30 seconds.</li>
		<li>Do not change jobs to spy on a faction, this is FailRP.</li>
		<li>If an admin is abusing post it on the forums with a screen shot or video.</li>
        <li>Your name must not be the same, or very similar to someone else's name. Staff impersonations are worth double the ban.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Staff <b>MUST</b> have proper names. No famous name or trolling names. They must be professional.</li>
        </ul>
		
		<li>A prop/structure/area which allows vision through one side only or less vision than the other side is not allowed. This applies to "killboxes", which gives the defenders of a base an unfair advantage when they are being raided.</li>
        <li>"God checking" Admin on Dutys is not allowed. This is still RDM.</li>
	</ol>

            </div>

                <p>This applies to all Military Factions (USMC, Cuban, Russian, German, Etc.) :</p>
	<font face=arial size=2>
                <ol>
		<li>All players must follow their commanding officer's orders (person ranked higher than you)</li>
		<li>All players must state when they are going to war with another faction before killing them; if you don't it's considered RDM. (Ex: /Advert: USMC Declares war on Cuba) YOU MUST PUT A REALISTIC RP REASON. You can be demoted or kicked if you do not comply.
		Some realistic examples are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>War on (FACTION) due to the attack on our troops.</li>
				<li>War on (FACTION) due to refusal to engage in peaceful negotiations</li>
				<li>War on (FACTION) in order to weaken their position of domination.</li>
				<li>War on (FACTION) in order to infiltrate their base and claim their money/printers and weapons.</li>
				<li>War on (FACTION) in order to defend the troops/property of (ALLY).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Only the highest ranking officer (currently online) can declare a war.</li>
		<li>Military Personnel of the same faction may <strong>NOT</strong> have multiple bases.(Example: Cubans build a base near spawn and one in the back of the map)</li>
		<li>If a player disobeys a truce between two factions they may be demoted.</li>
		<li>Military Personnel are not permitted to fire on civilians unless fired on first.</li>
		<li>All players must follow their commanding officer's orders. If not, the player is subject to kick/demotion.</li>
		<li>You cannot kill another military factionÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s personnel for reasons classifiable as metagaming if you are not at war with that faction (Example: Your friend IRL is killed by a Cuban and you are not at war with the Cuban Army).</li>
		<li>Military personnel must advert a raid assist when raiding with a scavenger. If you are a military faction and you are not accompanied by a scavenger, you do not have to advert raid.</li>
        <li> You may only kidnap a General of the Army and you must do "/advert Kidnap!" before kidnaping someone.</li>
        <li> You may only mug people as a scavenger or a terrorist.</li>
            <ul>
                <li> Minimum Mug Amount: $2<br> Maximum Mug Amount: $1,000</li>
                <li> You may only mug once every 5 minutes</li>
                <li> You must do "/advert Mug!" before mugging someone.</li>
        </ul>
	</ol>

            </div><br>
<div style="background-color: #041f45;">
        <center><font face=arial size=5 color="#FFFFFF"><b>Mercenary Rules</b></font></center>
            </div>
                <font face=arial>
			<ol>
				<li>Mercenaries are allowed to offensively attack another faction only if paid by a MILITARY faction. Military factions cannot pay them to attack civilians. A mercenary may only kill a scavenger if said scavenger is raiding their employer.</li>
				<li>Mercenaries are allowed to accept money for attacking an opposing faction, providing protection, etc. 
					<ul>
						<li>Minimum Price: $500</li>
						<li>Maximum Price: $1,000,000</li>
					</ul>
                    Each payment only lasts for one life and cannot be used to hire a mercenary for multiple lives. If there is a C.E.L.L Commander online and someone pays the Commander directly, your contract lasts until the Commander dies, or declares the contract as complete/over.</li>
                <li><strong>Mercenaries are not hitmen. They are not allowed to be hired to kill single people.</strong></li>
				<li>Mercenaries are allowed to team up with factions if paid by that faction.</li>
				<li>Mercenaries are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to be paid by civilians unless it's for protection.</li>
				<li>Mercenaries must advert each time they are hired, but do not have to disclose their employer if the employer has specifically asked them to do so.</li>
				<li>Mercenaries must advert that they are unhired or that their contract has ended upon their death.</li>
			</ol>
                </font>
		<h3><strong>Civilian and Scavenger Faction:</strong></h3>
			<font face=arial size=2>
                <ol>
				<li>Civilians are allowed to own weapons for self defense purposes only.</li>
				<li>Civilians are not allowed to raid, with or without factions.</li>
				<li>Scavengers are allowed to kill when raiding but must first advert raid. (Example: /advert Raiding!)</li>
				<li>Scavengers are permitted to raid any location.</li>
				<li>Scavengers are also subject to all NLR rules.</li>
                    <li>Scavengers may NOT abduct/kidnap people.</li>
			</ol>
                </font>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></p>
<p>Be sure to always screenshot or record (recording will help more) any type of rule breaking! This will speed up the punishment process or will allow admins to take immediate action. Also, use the forums to post ban requests or admin abuse reports! Your word counts!</p>
